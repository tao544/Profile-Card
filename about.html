      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        I’m still improving my confidence in JavaScript problem-solving and time management when facing large projects. 
        However, I’m working daily to overcome these challenges through practice and mentorship.

        Keep going no matter how challenging things get and never give up. Every small line of code adds up to something great.
